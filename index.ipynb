    "Li-GRUs were first introduced in [Light Gated Recurrent Units for Speaker Recognition (1803.10225)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10225). The core ideas behind Li-GRUs are that removing the reset gate from GRUs would be helpful as the past state is usually always relevant in the context of speech and coupled ReLU and BatchNorm instead of *tanh*. [PyTorch-Kaldi](https://github.com/mravanelli/pytorch-kaldi) found Li-GRU to be the best performing model on TIMIT, using a bidirectional 5-layer stack of Li-GRUs with `hidden_dim` of 550 and dropout of 0.2 between layers. \n",
